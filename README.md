## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to modificate a svg in HTML to have it responsive without any modification in CSS, change his color and size.
To make the website the more responsive I can using `clamp()` for margin, padding...
And to set the different item correctly and made them responsive.



### Continued development

I will continue to work making different website with Front-end Challenge, I learn from every challenge.



### Useful resources

- [Mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Very useful.
- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) - To have a better responsive design.
